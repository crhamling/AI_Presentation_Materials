They had assembled in the first-class lounge in an effort to **keep passengers calm and upbeat**. Later they moved on to the forward half of the boat deck. The band continued playing, even when it became apparent the ship was going to sink, and that all members would perish.\n",

    "* **KEY QUESTION: \"What factors made people more likely to survive?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    ">  \n",
    "\n",
    "**(1) Initial Line of Inquiry:**\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Did the **\"Chivalry\"** and the **\"Women and Children First\"** cultural imperative of the time period manifest itself in the data as it would be expected to?\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANALYSIS** - Interrogating the data has shown us:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There were more than **twice** as many females as males represented in those who **survived**. **[Males: 109 Females: 233]**\n",
    "* There were more that **five and a half** times as many males who **perished** than females. **[Males: 468 Females: 81]**\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore **reasonable to infer ** that the cultural imperative (Chivalry) of the time period **contributed significantly** as a factor in the survival rates at **78.67 %** accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    ">  \n",
    "\n",
    "**(2) Second Line of Inquiry:**\n",
    "\n",
    ">  Were the passengers chances of surviving the disaster related to their **gender and their social class**  as measured by the class in which the passenger traveled.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**ANALYSIS** - the contribution of Class ONLY **(Pclass = 1 or 2)** as an independent predictor to the survival rate is **significant** at **66.77 %** accuracy, which supports the argument that **social status played a significant role** in survival rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**(3) Third Line of Inquiry:**\n",
    "\n",
    ">   Were there unique (and occasionally non-intuitive) **combinations of features** contributing to survival rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANALYSIS** - The consideration of contributing factors in **isolation** is **not** sufficient to achieve more accurate prediction / understanding of survival rates, those factors need to be **considered in concert** with each other to better understand the total picture. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following contributing factors were **considered in concert** with each achieving a level of predictive accuracy at the ** 80 % ** range:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sex: Female** - this was the single most contributing factor toward survival. If one was female, they stood the best chance of survival.\n",
    "* **Pclass: 1 or 2 **- class was very significant in determining survival rates. The accuracy of the predictive powers of class were enhanced significantly when **Age** was combined. It seemed that **anyone under 18 who was in first or second class has a far better chance of survival**. \n",
    "* **Age and PClass** - Specifically **those under 1 years of age in 3rd class** stood a decent chance of survival. It would appear that the infants in 3rd class were given elevated priority. \n",

    "* Small and incomplete data set\n",
    "* Relative unsophisticated heuristics algorithm\n",

    "> The **small and incomplete data set**  is really the biggest limitation of this study. It's difficult to ferret out all of the features possible in route to developing a more accurate heuristic when the data is not a rich as it could be. This contributes to a **relatively unsophisticated heuristics algorithm**. Although the heuritsics algorithm is a product of intitution and an injection of Machine Leanning discoveries (feature engineering), it could be better, particularly in the last 15 - 18% accuracy (post 81%). Since there is a **lack of a dominant feature for that last percentage of accuracy**, it's difficult to make progress past 81% or so. Finally, the promise of accuracy advancements from **Machine Learning Decision Trees** was not taken as far as possible and could be improved.  \n",
